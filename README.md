- ðŸ¤– **Technical Skills**: Proficient in Python, PyTorch, Juce framework, and various machine learning and audio processing tools.

If you don't see many public projects, it's because I'm working on top-secret, cutting-edge projects that are so confidential I might end up in jail if I shared them. Stay tuned for more updates!
